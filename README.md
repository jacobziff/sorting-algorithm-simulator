# Sorting Algorithm Simulator

This is a simple program to display sorting algorithms virtually. Those included are:
* BubbleSort
* SelectionSort
* InsertionSort
* MergeSort
* QuickSort
* BogoSort
  
For this project, I chose to use C++ with the SFML library. It is my first time using anything visual beyond what can be displayed in a terminal with C++.

## Installation

Download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/jacobziff/sorting-algorithm-simulator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract/unzip it. The necessary files are the "Simulator" exe file and the "arial" ttf file located in the "assets" folder.

## Usage

All that is necessary is to run the "Simulator" exe file in the directory.  
  
Once started, the left and right arrow keys can be used to navigate between the three screens. The escape key can be used to exit the program. The "Instructions" screen lists further details about using the simulator.
